Sure, there are a few other models you can try for natural language to SQL translation. Here are some options, each with different strengths and weaknesses:

1. SQLNet:

    Pros: Specifically designed for SQL generation from natural language. Relatively lightweight and easy to train.
    Cons: May not perform as well on complex or ambiguous queries compared to larger models. Requires a specific dataset format.

2. Seq2SQL:

    Pros: Another model specifically for SQL generation. Has shown good results on various datasets.
    Cons: May also require fine-tuning on your specific dataset for optimal performance. Can be computationally intensive.

3. BART (or other large language models):

    Pros: Powerful language models with strong generalization capabilities. Can be fine-tuned for SQL generation.
    Cons: Fine-tuning can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. May not be as specialized as SQLNet or Seq2SQL.

4. TaBERT:

    Pros: Designed to understand both natural language and tabular data, making it suitable for tasks involving databases.
    Cons: May require more complex fine-tuning strategies compared to models specifically for SQL generation.

Choosing the Right Model:

The best model for you will depend on factors like:

    Complexity of your queries: If you have simple queries, SQLNet or Seq2SQL might be sufficient. For more complex queries, a larger model like BART or TaBERT might be needed.
    Size and format of your dataset: Some models require specific dataset formats. Consider the effort required to prepare your data.
    Computational resources: Fine-tuning large models requires significant GPU resources.

General Steps (Regardless of Model):

    Choose a model: Select a model based on the factors mentioned above.
    Gather and preprocess data: Prepare a dataset of paired natural language questions and SQL queries.
    Fine-tune the model: Train the chosen model on your dataset to optimize its performance for your specific task.


### 
### Flow of Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) and Natural Language (NL) Response

1. **User Input**
   - User enters a question in natural language (NL).

2. **Submit Query**
   - User clicks the "Submit" button.

3. **NL to SQL Conversion**
   - Capture user's NL question.
   - Generate SQL query from the NL question using the `generate_sql_chain` function.

4. **SQL Execution**
   - Execute the generated SQL query using the `execute_query` function.
   - Retrieve query results from the database.

5. **Result Processing**
   - Convert the SQL query results into a natural language response using the `generate_sql_to_nl` function.

6. **Display Response**
   - Display the NL response on the UI.
   - Optional: Show SQL query and results if the user selects this option.

7. **Show SQL Query and Results (Optional)**
   - Display the generated SQL query and results if the user selects the "Show SQL Query and Results" checkbox.

8. **Query History**
   - Save the user's question, generated SQL query, and NL response.
   - Display query history in the side menu.

9. **Repeat Process**
   - Allow the user to enter new questions and repeat the process.
